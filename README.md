_How can we produce a creative practice with code that is rooted in the local?_


## Context
Code is perceived as a mass output tool where “software” is associated with the strong visual language of Silicon Valley. Where computer-based sound and graphics seem to be only bips and bops and everything must appear like the shiny bright slits and geometric patterns of Tron legacy. 
With projects like code.drift and code.yatra we push this idea by moving our meaning and creative making into the places we inhabit and transit through. This allows us to use technology and tools to create new aesthetics and meaning for our situated contexts.

### What is Code.drift?
code.drift is an immersive creative coding practice and workshop series, developed by Ajaibghar. It uses live-coded visuals and music with the lived experience of cities. Drawing inspiration from the concept of the dérive—an unplanned journey through a landscape—code.drift transforms urban spaces into collaborators, using the environment as a creative partner.
Participants begin their creative exploration by "drifting" through a city, observing its rhythm, character, and energy. These urban impressions then serve as input for generative artwork, live coding performances, and collaborative projects. By situating creative technology within specific locales, code.drift invites new ways of seeing, learning, and making, blending culture and innovation in a seamless, organic practice.

We leverage open-source creative coding platforms such as P5JS & P5live, Hydra, Sonic Pi, and Strudel to create immersive, audio-visual cityscapes. 	
These creations are typically the result of collaboration between a sound artist and a visual artist, who perform in pairs, weaving together sound and visual narratives that reflect the unique character of each city.
