        "description": "code.drift is an immersive creative coding practice and workshop series, developed by Ajaibghar. It uses live-coded visuals and music with the lived experience of cities. Drawing inspiration from the concept of the dérive—an unplanned journey through a landscape—code.drift transforms urban spaces into collaborators, using the environment as a creative partner. We leverage open-source creative coding platforms such as P5JS & P5live, Hydra, Sonic Pi, and Strudel to create immersive, audio-visual cityscapes.",
