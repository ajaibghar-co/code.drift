# code.yatra

**code.yatra** — is a proposal for a travelling creative coding collaborative project with selected code.drift alumni who are designers/makers across smaller Indian cities. 
	
The code.yatra will cover **Udaipur, Jaipur, Baroda, and Rishikesh**, with a concluding week-long intensive at Godrej Archives and Factory in Mumbai. Selected participants will drift through these cities and develop immersive Audio/Visual performances from their experiences. Each city will have two key creators, who will collaborate on a unique performance that is steeped in the urban milieu of the locale. 

As part of the code.yatra they will also share the philosophy and practice of code.drift in select venues with local creators and designers. Opening up the idea that designers can use creative coding as an exciting tool in their design practice. 
The project will conclude with an immersive audio-visual live performance with 8 artists (the code.yatris) at Conscious Collective 2025 (organised by Godrej), bringing together coding, generative art & music, and city-based inspirations from the entire yatra.


> By facilitating a creative journey across diverse Indian cities, code.yatra highlights the intersection of art, technology, and community, challenging dominant narratives about the use of creative technology in Indian contexts.

## Strategy

## Purpose

### Why is code.drift important to creative sector in India?

- Creative coding as an emerging experimental space for designers which lacks design focussed capacity building
- code.drift and code.yatra act as a bridge between indian knowledge/design/craft/cities and technology 
- code.drift and code.yatra’s deep practice of situatedness within Indian cityscapes and emerging technology allow for a paradigm shift for the Indian design methodology and pedagogy. With deep respect for the past and present contexts of Indian Design, it forges a careful, critical and introspective path for the future of Indian Design which is highly interconnected with technology.


## Impact

What will achieve at the end of the fellowship:
- **Immersive performance showcasing creative coding** 
		Code.yatra will culminate with an immersive live-coding performance at Conscious Collectice 2025
		
- **Code.Yatra website and journal**
- **code.yatri experiences and code snippets**
  Code.yatris’ experiences and processes will be documented, along with their code snippets. This will serve as inspirational material for others! 
- **Community building toolkit**
  The website will have an approachable toolkit - a “make your own code.drift” kit of sorts. This will encourage and set up support systems and guidelines for anyone who wants to build a local code.drift cohort. 

- **Code playgrounds**
	The code playgrounds will contain several examples, tips and tricks that can support beginner to advanced learning of creative coding tools.

- **Documentation Video** 
	With the code.yatra will be documentation that will produce a short film about the project, that can be reused to showcase the code.drift philosophy and format
	
- **Local Community Engagement with diverse groups in 4 cities**:
  - underprivileged girls in vocational tech education centre in Udaipur
  - professional designers & design studios in Jaipur
  - art college students and creative tech studio in Baroda
  - music & film enthusiasts in Rishikesh
 

Code.yatra offers a simple format for building skill and confidence around emerging technology in Design. Our primary focus is that code.drift can be imbibed as a design methology. 

**In the long term, we believe that it will:**

- Upskilling several designers and creators who are interested in exploring creative coding and other technologies as a key tool in their design practice.
- This will also directly impact innovative design responses that don’t use tech for tech sake but are able to use technology with the sensibilities and sensitivity of emerging design practices rooted in the contemporary cultural contexts of India.
- Format of playgrounds and toolkits focussed on tech learning for creators will provide a playful and encouraging space for creators
- In particular, we find that code.drift has been instrumental in bringing on board several women creators, traditionally women creators shy away from STEM learning and this will be a great way to shatter that lack of diversity.

**In the near term, code.yatra will be able to:**

- Create high-impact engagement around tech-design in smaller cities. Estimating atleast 100-200 creators engaging with the program through the local community events bringing to light our efforts
- We estimate between the social media presence of Ajaibghar, Nanditi and Computational Mama code.yatra will reach about 6000 followers (a lot more if reshared by Godrej Design Lab). This means that diverse audiences are exposed to the idea of code.drift and code.yatra as a growing philosophy of engaging with design and tech, also highlighting design communities in tier 2 and 3 cities.
- Our performance at Conscious Collective and video documentation throughout the fellowship will have live audience of designers and creators and will be recorded and shared through various channels (estimating offline and online audience of 500 people)
